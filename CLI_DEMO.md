# Full Crisis CLI Menu System Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a TUI-based menu system for the full-crisis-bin project that replaces the text-based input system with an interactive menu interface using ratatui's built-in List widgets (instead of the problematic tui-menu library).

## Implementation Features

### ✅ Main Menu with Navigation
- **Menu Options**: Continue Game, New Game, Settings, Licenses, Quit
- **Navigation**: ↑/↓ arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select, Esc to quit
- **Visual**: Clean interface with highlighted selection using cyan background

### ✅ Settings Grid Interface (2x2 Layout)
The settings screen displays four setting categories in a grid:

#### Top Row:
1. **Difficulty** (Left)
   - Options: Easy, Medium, Hard  
   - Visual: Yellow highlight when selected
   - Navigation: ↑/↓ to change selection

2. **Language** (Right)
   - Options: All supported languages with display names
   - Format: "English (eng)", "Español (spa)", etc.
   - Visual: Green highlight when selected
   - Navigation: ↑/↓ to change selection

#### Bottom Row:
3. **Autosave** (Left)
   - Options: Enabled, Disabled
   - Visual: Magenta highlight when selected
   - Navigation: ↑/↓ to change selection

4. **Crises Folder** (Right)
   - Text input field for folder path
   - Visual: Yellow highlight when selected, Cyan when editing
   - Input: Direct text editing with real-time saving

### ✅ Navigation System
- **Tab**: Cycle through setting sections
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate within sections and between sections
- **Enter**: Select/confirm current option or start editing text field
- **Esc**: Return to main menu (clearly displayed in instructions)

### ✅ Automatic Settings Persistence
- All settings changes are saved immediately when confirmed
- Uses the existing full_crisis storage system
- Compatible with the iced GUI settings format

### ✅ Visual Feedback
- Each settings section has distinct highlight colors
- Clear visual indicators for current selection
- Instructions displayed at bottom of screen
- Proper spacing and borders for clarity

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Changes
1. **Removed tui-menu dependency** - Used ratatui's built-in List widgets instead for better reliability
2. **Added public storage module** - Exposed storage functions from full_crisis library
3. **State management** - Clean separation between UI state and application state
4. **Menu navigation** - Robust navigation system with proper wrapping

### Key Components
- `AppState` enum: Tracks whether we're in MainMenu or Settings
- `SettingsSection` enum: Tracks which setting is currently selected
- `AppData` struct: Maintains all UI state and settings
- Separate rendering functions for main menu and settings
- Comprehensive input handling for different contexts

### Integration
- Seamlessly integrates with existing full_crisis game engine
- Uses the same settings structure as the iced GUI
- Settings are immediately compatible between CLI and GUI modes
- Proper game state management for transitions to other screens

## Usage Instructions

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build --bin full-crisis

# Run CLI interface
./target/debug/full-crisis cli
```

### Controls:
- **Main Menu**: ↑/↓ to navigate, Enter to select, Esc to quit
- **Settings**: Tab/Arrows to navigate sections, Enter to select/edit, Esc to return
- **Text Input**: Type to edit, Backspace to delete, Enter to confirm

## Files Modified

1. **`full-crisis-bin/Cargo.toml`** - Added serde_json dependency
2. **`full-crisis-bin/src/cli/mod.rs`** - Complete rewrite with menu system
3. **`full-crisis/src/lib.rs`** - Added public storage module
4. **`full-crisis/src/gui/settings.rs`** - Updated storage references  
5. **`full-crisis/src/crisis/operations.rs`** - Updated storage references

## Result

The implementation provides a professional, user-friendly terminal interface that matches the requirements:
- ✅ Menu-based navigation instead of typed commands
- ✅ Settings grid with menu selections for Difficulty, Autosave, Language
- ✅ Text input for crises folder
- ✅ Automatic settings persistence
- ✅ ESC key returns to main menu with clear instructions
- ✅ Clean, responsive UI with proper visual feedback
